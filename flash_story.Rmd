Minimal-E (Palo Alto, CA) has launched a revolutionary online platform that will allow facility managers, utility companies, city commissions, and building automation systems to implement better energy saving plans and storage systems for commercial buildings with minimal data. Such forecastings have been a challenge due to lack of extensive historical data, but Minimal-Eâ€™s revolutionary machine-learning based platform seeks to solve that.

Their platform lets end users (facility managers, utility companies, city commissions, etc.) input one week of consumption data for a particular building. It then provides graphical and numerical displays of future consumption forecastings, for up to three weeks.With this new technology, the energy consumption industry has been blown away. Now, managers of new and renovated buildings will actually be able to think about energy and cost saving systems from the start!
